    <body style="background-color:floralwhite;">
        <h1 style="background-color:burlywood;"> This is what the largest heading looks like. It is referred to as h1.</h1>
        <h2> This is h2. Smaller than h1, bigger than h3. Goes all the way to h6!</h2>
        <p style="color:burlywood;" title="This is a paragraph">The content in here is in a paragraph container. Notice the difference?
            Everything I have learned comes from w3schools c: I'll link it down below.
            Underneath that, I'll add an image of their logo for reference, which if you click on, will also be a link to the page.

            Quick note, the breaks in this paragraph come from the br tag. If you want breaks outside of a paragraph, use the hr tag.
            <br>
            The hr tag is displayed as a horizontal line, which explains where the line below this text came from.
            <br>
            <pre>
                Using br every time you want a new line can be annoying. 
                The solution is to use the pre element.
                This prints the text in the format it appears in the source code.
                These last few sentences were blocked in a pre tag!
                The style of the pre tag can be modified using a style tag c:
            </pre>
            <br>
            <pre style="font-family:verdana; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">
                This is also in a pre element.
                Do you notice the font type and size difference?
                Also look at the location of the text relative to the page.
            </pre>

            <pre style="border:2px solid burlywood">
                <b>This text is bolded.</b>
                <strong>This text is surrounded by the strong tag to define text with importance.</strong>
                While both text lines appear to be bolded - and are -, always try to use the tag for their purpose.
                Don't use the strong tag for text you want to just be bolded, and vice versa.
                <i>This text is in italics. The i tag is used typically for text that is normally italicized. </i>
                <em>
                This text is emphasized. Similar to the strong element in relation to the b tag, The em tag
                appears in italics, but is not to be used in place of the i tag. Use it for emphasizing text!
                Furthermore, a screenreader will read the information in an em tag with verbal stress.
                </em>
                <small>The small tag defines <mark>small</mark> text.</small>
                Did you notice the word small in the small text - lol -. It was marked with the mark tag for emphasis.
                This emphasis is demonstrated as <del>yellow highlight</del>.
                <ins>Why is there a line through yellow highlight?</ins> 
                It's there to demonstrate how the del tag works. I was going to erase that line as it seemed redundant and obvious,
                but it seemed a perfect chance to demonstrate how the del tag works hehe.
                I also took the opportunity to show how the ins tag works. It underlines text to show that text was inserted.
                This text shows how the sub tag works <sub>It's a subscript.</sub>
                Similarly, the sup tag shows a <sup>superscript.</sup>
                Here is going to be an example of a blockquote. 
                <blockquote cite="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quotation_elements.asp">
                    The HTML blockquote element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
                </blockquote>
                For short quotations, you use q - <q> Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
                </q>

                The abbr tag is used to define abbreviations -> An example is <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>.
                An example of a citation: 
                <cite>Starry Night</cite> by Vincent van Goh. Painted in 1889.
                <bdo dir="rtl"> This text demonstrates bidirectional override, aka bdo</bdo>
                Colors can be defined in many ways: rgb, hex, rgba, hsla, hsl.
                RGB = Red, Green, Blue. Values can range from 0 to 255.
                RGBA = Red, Green, Blue, Alpha (alpha = opacity).
                HEX = RedRed, GreenGreen, BlueBlue. Composed of Hex values.
                HSL = Hue, Saturation, Lightness.
                HSLA = Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha.

            </pre>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h1 style="font-size:10px;">This is also h1, but the font size has been overridden using the font-size property.</h1>
        <address>
            My address would go here in the address tag<br>
            Use line breaks - br - to format everything.
